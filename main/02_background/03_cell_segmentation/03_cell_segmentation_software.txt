Modern cell segmentation can be used to provide accurate data about the shape and behaviour of cells in many different settings. Different types of light can be used to highlight features of interest or cause material in the cells to fluoresce and be more easily visible. Several different stains can target different parts of cells (cytoplasm, cytoskeleton) to build up a more detailed segmentation.

Most segmentation algorithms focus on distinguishing continuous edges and solid blobs of uniform colour. When edges are clearly visible, objects are easier to pick out and mark as cells. Many algorithms begin to fail when edges become harder to differentiate from the background. This can happen when an object of interest is out of focus due to the optical configuration of the microscope. If the environment in the images is planar, this problem will not occur, but if the environment is extends into 3D, different parts of an image will segment unevenly, possibly affecting the usefulness of the data.
