Areas in an image of continuous colour are known as blobs. They can be indicative of solid objects or regions in the background. Typically, an object's interior will be a blob and its edge will separate it from the background. Blobs can have a characteristic size and intensity profile measured from the edge or centre. The intensity profile can be modelled using a function in much the same way as an edge. Locating blob centres can be useful in the first step of segmentation to get a general idea of where objects of interest might be located. This is known as a "primary" object. Once the location of a primary object is known, "secondary" objects can be searched for in the immediate vicinity. The primary object does not necessarily have to be a single point, but can be an extended region with features of its own. These can be preserved to encourage further segmentation around them. This can be useful for discovering finer details of cell protrusions or other boundaries.

Blobs can be found using several methods, most notably the LoG/DoG (Laplacian of Gaussian/Difference of Gaussians) methods. These general functions model the intensity profile of a blob from its centre to an edge and approximate its size using the parametres of a Gaussian, the mean and variance. These approximate shapes can then be convolved with the image yielding a bright "response" at the location of each blob of the same size. Difference of Gaussians is often chosen as a computationally "cheaper" approximate of the LoG method, since it does not require differentiation.
