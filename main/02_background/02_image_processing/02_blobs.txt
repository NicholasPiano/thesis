Areas in an image of continuous colour are known as blobs. They can be indicative of solid objects or regions in the background. Typically, an object's interior will be a blob and its edge will separate it from the background. Blobs can have a characteristic size and intensity profile measured from the edge or centre. The intensity profile can be modelled using a function in much the same way as an edge. Locating blob centres can be useful in the first step of segmentation to get a general idea of where objects of interest might be located. This is known as a "primary" object. Once the location of a primary object is known, "secondary" objects can be searched for in the immediate vicinity of the primary.
