After the images have been captured, the cells can be located. This can be done manually by adjusting the parameters available (focus, GFP intensity) until the cells are visible enough to be recognised by eye, but for high throughput and statistically significant data, it is preferable to recognise the cells automatically, even if this means sacrificing the accuracy in terms of cell shape or position. Some common techniques can be used to make features of cells more recognisable for appropriate software. Outlining objects makes use of their edges, which can be described mathematically. Continuous areas of a single or similar colours, known as “blobs”, can also be found, perhaps indicating the interiors of cells. After these, more complex features such as corners in 2D and 3D can be detected, along with cell-like pattern matching and iterative learning for repeated studies.
