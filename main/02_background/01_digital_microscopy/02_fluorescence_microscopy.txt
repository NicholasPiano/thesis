In general, cells are translucent and colourless, making them difficult to see in most brightfield images. To work with this, cells can be stained with a variety of dyes to help them show up in the images. Most of these methods require the cells to be fixed (dead), but several can be used for live cell imaging, for example, GFP or Green Fluorescent Protein, which binds to the cellâ€™s DNA inside the cytoplasm of the cell. When exposed to a blue or ultra-violet light, the GFP will fluoresce and make the marked cells more identifiable. The cytoplasm extends within the cell interior, but does not penetrate the nucleus or the cell wall. This makes the GFP ideal for indicating the bulk of the cell, but not for accurately locating the edges of cells.

The GFP images can be considered another grayscale channel in the image set and can be combined with brightfield to highlight features of the cells. The light is typically provided by a laser shining through the sample. The power of the laser can be controlled and should be as high as possible to ensure a high response from the GFP, but low enough to allow the cells to survive for the duration of the imaging, since the laser can cause the cells to heat up and behave strangely or die. The cells might also require a cooldown period between frames to ensure that they are not damaged.
