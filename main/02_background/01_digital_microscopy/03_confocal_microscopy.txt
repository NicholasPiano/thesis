Confocal microscopy uses an optical setup that allows an extended 3D environment to be captured uniformly by recording images from focal planes at regular intervals. This removes the problem of certain objects of interest being out of focus by simply capturing all planes, so that they are in focus in some subset of the data. When used to record fluorescence images, a confocal microscope can also ensure that there is little to no interference between focal planes, meaning that bright points occurring at a certain vertical position in an image set were captured from the same vertical position in the environment. This allows objects marked with a fluorescent dye to be located reliably in 3D.

To avoid distortion, the sample is moved incrementally under the objective lens by means of a moving stage. The stage stops at regular intervals in all three dimensions to capture images. Spending a roughly equal amount of time at each position, the stage makes an imaging cycle with a consistent duration. This can include a cooldown for the fluorescence if necessary. Different wavelengths of light can have different penetration depths or transmission properties in the material, potentially causing images in one channel to be shifted or stronger at different levels than other channels.

Microscope are also sometimes equipped with autofocus software which attempts to keep the focal plane of the images constant between frames, accounting for any shift that might occur during imaging. The algorithm responsible for this sorts potential focal planes into in-focus, above-focus, and below-focus groups to decide which level to pick. Unfortunately, this is not alway reliable and can result in some fluctuation of the focal plane. This must be compensated for in the post-processing.
