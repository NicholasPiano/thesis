The context of cell segmentation requires an overview of digital microscopy; its capabilities and limitations. Almost all medical studies are subject to the limits of digital microscopy and its effects on the data available from an experiment. Digital images are discretised into pixels with a small range of intensities (0-255). These are stored as grayscale values, and different colours or channels must be stored as separate images or inside formatted composite images. This pixelation, not only in space, but also in colour puts limits on the confidence of data coming out. The difference made in half a point of intensity could shift the boundary of an object or region. While this can be compensated for by decreasing the field of view, hence increasing the resolution of the area of interest, this error is never insignificant.

The main set of data used in the this study came from brightfield microscope images, discussed first. Next; a description of fluorescence microscopy and its applications in cell studies. Finally, the main setup will be described; a confocal microscope used for live cell imaging. The principles of these materials will be used to justify the need for this project and its results.
