The GFP profile is a mathematical description of the intensity distribution in the pixels near a cell. The coordinate system defined in the previous subsection  allows a range of pixels in a bounded volume to be analysed. A profile in this case refers to an array of pixel values taken from a range of Z points at a constant XYTC position.The values can also be a combination of values taken from an XY mask of a certain area centred on a constant XY at constant TC. A profile will give a unique value for each Z and form a distribution.

The GFP channel stores 3D information, so the information found at a Z coordinate will be relevant to the same Z position in the environment. A profile at an XYT location will have low values at Z positions where there are no objects present, but high values when an object exists. A profile that passes through a cell will increase from the background value to a high value at the centre of a cell and then decrease on the other side. If this distribution is normalise, it can be compared to the distributions found in every other pixel. There are three parameters that are used to describe a distribution. Once normalised, the variance of the distribution is the amount by which the it increases when encountering an object. The mean is the mean value of all values in the distribution. The Z position of the distribution is the Z coordinate where the maximum peak of the distribution occurs. In reality, this is the centre of the cell in Z.

This is dependent on the smoothing filter applied to the GFP data to reduce noise and the size of the mask used to create a profile. Mixing information in the GFP can lead to Z values of neighbouring pixels to become closer and have a smoother gradient among groups of pixels.
