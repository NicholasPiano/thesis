This section introduces the zMod compression algorithm, developed to solve the problem of segmentation in a 3D environment. It is similar to many methods of projecting a 3D stack of images into a 2D image [ref][ref]. Projection refers to the selection of pixel values from a Z range based on some criterion [ref]. For example, the stack could select the maximum pixel found as a representative of a single XY location. One can also choose the minimum, or any other statistical parameter of the data. Using all values in an XY location, one can compute their sum or multiple and use this as a final pixel value for the 2D image. In the case of zMod, the pixel selected from the stack is based on an analysis of a different channel. Specifically, the parameters of the stack in the GFP channel are used to choose a pixel value from the brightfield.

In the first subsection, some definitions and terminology are detailed to set up the algorithm. The coordinate system used to describe properties of the images mathematically, the distributions present in the images such as cell protrusions, edges, and profiles in both the GFP channel and the Brightfield, and the different intensity scales used to combine images need to be clarified. ** The following aspects of the algorithm are described - the blah, the blah and the blah.

The next subsection describes the most crucial component of the algorithm; the GFP profile. This is used to make decisions* about the pixel values that will be chosen for the final segmentation image. Its mathematical description and justification will be shown. *you could be more specific

The last subsection will describe the algorithm itself and some of the decisions made* about its working. The algorithm is dependent on sensitive parameters* that needed to be fixed. The choices of fixed parameters and the reasoning behind them are given. *more specific?

Finally, justifiction for the choice of fixed parameters such as the estimated object size is presented.
