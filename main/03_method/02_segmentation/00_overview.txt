After the images have been modified, they can be run through* CellProfiler or another cell recogniser to find objects. The zBF image can be adjusted by changing the three parameters (Delta-Z, Gaussian kernel size, and linear mask size), but the Delta-Z chosen in this work yields thick dark edges and uniform bright interiors. The intensity of the interior is very close to that of the background. If the dark edge is not complete, i.e. there is a small gap allowing the background to connect to the interior, the recognition could extend into the background from the intended object segmentation.  This effect will often happen with long cell protrusions as the material stretches and becomes thinner at the end. To prevent this, a further modification can be made using additional 3D information.

This section details the parameters chosen to achieve good segmentation with CellProfiler, some comments on the behaviour of CellProfiler algorithms, and the further modifications made to the images, zDiff and zEdge, to ensure more consistent segmentation. *too long of a sentence
