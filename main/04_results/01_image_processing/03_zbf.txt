The zBF image is a very useful tool for segmenting an entire 3D environment with a single image. It clearly shows objects in focus (subject to adjustment of Delta-Z) regardless of their position in the environment. The information from different parts of the Brightfield stack has been "fetched" by the zMod image and placed into a single plane. There are also some notable disadvantages that should be mentioned.

Advantages

1. "Flattens" a 3D environment. Brings objects from different levels into focus.



2. Allows for quick global cell segmentation.
3. Can be adjusted via Delta-Z.

Disadvantages

1. Does not avoid unclear or ambiguous edges in the Brightfield.
2. Cannot reveal objects that lie underneath other matter.
3. Areas of cells that do not contain much GFP might not be placed at the correct level
