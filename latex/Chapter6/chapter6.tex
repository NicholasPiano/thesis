\section{Summary}

In summary, the findings of this study include a method hat uses 3D GFP image data from a confocal microscope to 

New method can exploit the 3D representation possible with GFP to correct focus fluctuations in the brightfield and greatly improve segmentation accuracy.

\section{Observations}

Segmentation accuracy increased by an order of magnitude.

\section{Further work}

Could be used to help locate seeds in images to simplify microscope imaging.
Currently the method only does pre-processing. Can be used instead to do segmentation directly using more information than a current segmentation algorithm is able to use.
