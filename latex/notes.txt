Corrections from Carola

1. Abbreviations should be defined.

2. All figure legends require more detail.

3. Needs to demonstrate basic understanding of use of GFP in cell biology and the implications for how the variables in its use may influence image analysis.

4. Explain how CellProfiler works.

5. Clarify throughout aims of the project regarding segmentation and protrusions.

6. Clarify the work you did and that which others did.

7. Fig 2.4 indicate method of segmentation used.

8. Make clear shortcomings of previous method which project aims to address in 3.4.

9. Cite Fig 6.5 in text.

10. Reorganise chapters 6 and 7.

11. Include the comparison with previous approaches as in slide 21 of the presentation to demonstrate the degree to which it has improved segmentation.

12. Emphasise benefits of new approach in conclusion chapter and identify using it to better identify protrusions as future work.

13. Ensure references are complete and uniform in presentation.


Revised corrections:

1. Demonstrate understanding of GFP. BACKGROUND

2. Explain CellProfiler. BACKGROUND

3. Clarify aim of project regarding cell shapes and protrusions.

4. Clearly separate the work done from previous work.

5. Use area segmentation to compare results with previous work. If not comparable, find some metric to compare them with.

6. Emphasise benefits of new approach in conclusion chapter and identify using it to better identify protrusions as future work.
